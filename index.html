        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="resume-section-body">
        <p>I am traditionally a full-stack developer who has focused the past few years on learning front-end technologies in order to move to a more front-end heavy role. I have knowledge in various modern web technologies, with a specific focus on those that aren't reliant on heavy frameworks. I tend to start a project using vanilla JS/ES6 with Babel, PostCSS/SASS, Tape testing framework, and Browserify/Rollup with NPM scripts to transpile/bundle, and add larger tools as a project grows if needed. I have 9 months of working experience in Angular 2/4 creating a front-end heavy geospatial application with Leaflet. I also have some basic knowledge of React and web components, but haven't used them in a professional capacity as of yet. I am continuing to improve upon this website to keep my skills in each of these areas sharp. Please look over my previous experience and skills and contact me if you have any questions or if you would like me to join your team!</p>
