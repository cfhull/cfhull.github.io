JavaScript,4,"I really love working in JavaScript - it's so versatile, and I like the front end aspect that it's usually associated with. I have a good amount of hands-on experience, some of which you can see on this site, as well as professional work with PlanetRisk and Ellucian. I try to use vanilla JS as much as I can, but I've also used tools/frameworks such as JQuery/Angular4/TypeScript. I'd love any opportunity to do more JavaScript work."
D3.js,2,"This site contains all the D3.js I've done to date. It's a lot of fun, and I hope to keep adding functionality on this site as I get better at interactive data visualizations. I would love a professional opportunity to work on this."
HTML,4,"Overall I'm pretty solid with HTML and how it interacts with CSS and JavaScript. Feel free to check out the source code on this site."
CSS,3,"I like CSS. I've done a decent amount of work in it, as you can see on this site. I'm familiar with both SASS and PostCSS"
Linux,3,"I use Arch Linux at home because it's really fun, even though it breaks on me. Most of my knowledge comes from setting up Arch, and using the Arch wiki to fix issues. I also like customizing my system, so I learn a lot from that as well."
Bash,2,"I know a bit of bash from using Linux but I'm no pro...yet. I know most of the basic commands and how to use man pages and other resources to create simple scripts."
Git,3,"I use Git and GitHub for all of my personal projects as well as professional work. I have also used git flow while working on small teams."
Unity,2.5,"I've used Unity during a few game jams in the DC area, as well as during a short-term contract creating an educational platformer."
C#/.NET,3.5,"I'm comfortable writing in .NET. At PlanetRisk our backend was .NET for our geospatial Angular 4 application. At Ellucian I used C# when creating plugins and workflows for Dynamics CRM. I also use C# when using Unity."
